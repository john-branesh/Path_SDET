Test Plan Overview:-
This test plan outlines the approach to testing the VWO Web Login Page to ensure functionality, security, performance, and usability across different environments and user scenarios.

Features to be Tested:-

Functional Testing:
✔ Verify successful login with valid credentials.
✔ Verify login fails for invalid credentials (wrong email/password).
✔ Verify login field validations (empty email, empty password).
✔ Verify case sensitivity in email and password fields.
✔ Verify password masking (should display as dots/asterisks).
✔ Verify "Forgot Password" link redirects to the reset page.
✔ Verify error messages appear correctly for failed login attempts.
✔ Verify login behavior with remember me option checked/unchecked.

UI/UX Testing:
✔ Verify all UI elements (input fields, buttons, labels, error messages) are properly aligned.
✔ Verify the login button is disabled until valid inputs are entered.
✔ Verify responsiveness on mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
✔ Verify browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

Security Testing:
✔ Verify account lockout mechanism after multiple failed attempts.
✔ Verify session timeout behavior after inactivity.
✔ Verify encryption of credentials (Inspect network requests).
✔ Verify SQL Injection and XSS protection in login fields.
✔ Verify user is redirected to login after logout.

Performance Testing:
✔ Verify login works smoothly under high user load.
✔ Measure login page load time under normal and heavy load conditions.
✔ Verify API response time when logging in.

Compatibility Testing:
✔ Test login on different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari.
✔ Test login on different devices: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android.

Test Approach:
Testing will be performed manually for UI/functional testing.
Automation scripts may be developed for repetitive functional scenarios using Selenium + Java.
Security and performance testing will use Postman, JMeter, and Burp Suite.
Browser compatibility will be tested using BrowserStack/Sauce Labs.

Test Data:
  Valid Login:

    Email: user@example.com
    Password: Password123
    Expected Result: Successful login
    Invalid Email:

    Email: invaliduser
    Password: Password123
    Expected Result: "Invalid email format" error
    Empty Fields:

    Email: (empty)
    Password: (empty)
    Expected Result: "Fields cannot be empty" error
    Wrong Password:

    Email: user@example.com
    Password: WrongPass
    Expected Result: "Incorrect password" error

Exit Criteria:
✔ 95% of test cases executed successfully.
✔ No critical/blocker defects remain open.
✔ Login page meets security, performance, and usability standards.

Risks & Mitigation:
Login API downtime: Test with mock API responses to simulate login behavior.
Browser compatibility issues: Use cross-browser testing tools like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs.
High user load: Perform load testing with JMeter to ensure system stability.
